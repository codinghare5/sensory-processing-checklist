## Instruction for the Sensory Proessing Checklist

The instructions for the sensory processing checklist in the book are:
**Was True**: was true at any time in the past: in brackets specify the age of the child when the statement was true - eg (two-five years)
**True**: True now (if it was true and is true now tick both answers)
**False**: False (if the statement is not true)
**Not Sure**: Not sure or don't know

Then the instructions go on to say: "Additional information is welcome: write it near the question, or copy the question number on a blank sheet of paper and add the information there. 

Please try to answer all the questions."

In a footnote the book says:
"Interpretation should be conducted very carefully. It is not enough to tick the box and then label the behaviour 'according to the number in the table'. The causes of one and the same behaviour may be different and should be identified. For example, hypersensitivity may be caused by sensory overload, or be a constant characteristic of this particular child, or because the child uses one channel (mono-processing) to get the information in the situation he or she is in, or because this channel 'is doing two jobs' - its own and compensating for some other unreliable sense - becoming easily overloaded and hypersensitive."
